          <p>We're a collection of fourteen individuals from all walks of life.  We each bring unique skill sets and life experiences to our collective learning environment.  Most importantly, we're all here to learn how to make the user experience cleaner, faster, and more responsive.</p>

        <p>We are interested in challenging ourselves with new concepts everyday.  Our environment is open and supportive - there are no stupid questions.  Through mutual education, we cement our own understanding and grow our community.</p>

        <p>Of course, sometimes so much intensity leads to unforseen consequences...</p>
